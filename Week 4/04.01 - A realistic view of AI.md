# 04.01 - A realistic view of AI

---

### Goldilocks rule for AI
- Taking a realistic, in-between view is just right.
    - For Goldilocks, oatmeal should be neither too hot or too cold. Bed should not be too soft or too sirm
- We should apply a similar idea:
    - Too optimistic: AI will solve all of humanity's problems and create utopia
    - Too pessimistic: Super intelligent/sentient killer AI can lead to human extinction
    - Just right: AI is a powerful tool, but has limitations. We can mitigate its' potential harms and use it to create tremendous value

### Limitations of AI
- Performance limitations
- Explainability is hard (but sometimes doable)
    - Many high-performing AI are black boxes, but the AI doesn't know how to explain how it does what it does.
- Real life example is on an x-ray when an AI says that a scan shows a right-sided pneumothorax (collapsed lung)
    - How do we know?
    - Heat map has been added to give insight

- Biased AI through biased data
- Adversarial attacks on AI
