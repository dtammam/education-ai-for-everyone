# More examples of what machine learning can and cannot do

---

### Self-driving car
- Let's say you're building a self driving car

#### Can do:
- Something AI can do pretty well is taking a picture of what's in front of the car (in combo with radar/lidar) to find the position of other cars
- The input (a) can be a picture, or picture + radar + lidar and the output (b) can be the location of other cars

#### Cannot do:
- It cannot take the input of a human in front of the car, and gather the intent of the person, examples being:
    - Construction worker telling you to stop
    - Hitchhiker asking for a ride
    - Biker using their hand for a turn signal
- In this example the input (a) would be the gesture and the output (b) would be the intention
- This is complicated because there are so many types of gestures and intents and not enough data to capture the richness of different human intentions
- Because this is a safety-critical application, you'd want an AI that is highly accurate, and this makes it harder

#### The difference
- If you were to get 10,000 pictures of other cars, many teams would be able to build an AI system that has a basic capability of detecting other cars
- In contrast, if you were to get 10,000 pictures of people gesturing at your car, even with that dataset, it wouldn't be enough to create a consistent enough mechanism to rely on it accurately understanding

### X-ray diagnosis
- Another example of what could be applied is with regards to an x-ray

#### Can do
- Diagnose pneumonia from 10000 labeled images
- Input (a) would be x-rays, output (b) would be a diagnosis

#### Cannot do
- Diagnose pneumonia from 10 images of a medical textbook chapter explaining pneumonia

### Strengths and weaknesses of machine learning

#### ML tends to work well when:
1. Learning is a "simple" concept
2. There is lots of data available

#### ML tends to work poorly when:
1. Learning complex concepts from small amounts of data
2. It is asked to perform on new types of data

- An example would be if a system is trained on x-ray data that was taken when a patient is laying down straight in a high quality medical center, and apply it to new images where patients lay on the right... the performance would likely be poor. An AI team would be able to remediate this problem but it wouldn't be easy
- Humans are more adaptable in the ways that AI systems are less robust (generalizing, figuring out what to do with new types of data)
