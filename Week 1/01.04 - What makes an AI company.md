# 01.04 - What makes an AI company

---

### A lesson from the rise of the Internet
- Shopping mall + website =/= Internet company
- The main idea is that an Internet company is one that takes advantage of what the Internet is uniquely good at and enables one to do. Some examples:
    - A/B testing, routinely turn on two different versions of a website and see what does better
    - Short iteration times, you can ship a new product every week
    - Decision making pushed down to engineers and other specialized roles

### How about the AI era?
- Any company + deep learning =/= AI company
- What makes a great AI company is a company that does things that AI enables one to do very well
    - Strategic data acquisition, deliberately launch things that will fail to get data
    - Unified data warehouses, if you have 50 different data warehouses under the control of 50 different VPs, it'd be impossible for an engineer to get data together and connect dots
    - Pervasive automation, very good at spotting oppportunities for a to b mappings and automating
    - New roles (e.g. Machine Learning Engineer (MLE)) and division of labor

### AI Transformation
- Brief overview:
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
   - Get a sense of what it can/cannot do and what a project feels like
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
4. Develop an AI strategy
5. Develop internal and external communications
