# 03.05 - AI Pitfalls to Avoid

---

### AI pitfalls to avoid
#### Don't:
- Expect AI to solve everything
- Hire 2-3 ML engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases
- Expect the AI project to work the first time
- Expect traditional planning processes to apply without changes
- Think you need superstar AI engineers before you can do anything

#### Do:
- Be realistic about what AI can and cannot do given limitations of technoloigy, data, and engineering resources
- Pair engineering talent with business talent and work cross-functionally to find feasible and valuable projects
- Plan for AI development to be an iterative process, with multiple attempts needed to proceed
- Work with AI team to establish timeline estimates, milestones, KPIs, etc.
- Keep building the team and get going with what you have, realizing that many AI engineers today do a great job building valuable and meaningful systems
