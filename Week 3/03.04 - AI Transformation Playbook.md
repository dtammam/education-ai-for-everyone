### AI Transformation Playbook
1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
2. Build an in-house AI team
3. Provide broad AI training
4. Develop an AI strategy
5. Develop internal and external communications

### 1. Execute pilot projects to gain momentum
- More important for the initial project to succeed rather than to be the most valuable
- Show traction within 6-12 months
- Can be in-house or outsourced

### 2. Build an in-house AI team
- Build a centralized AI team
- Input folks/work into different business units
- AI function can be under CTO, CIO, CDO, etc. or a new CAIO

### 3. Provide broad AI training
| Role | What they should learn 
|:---------|:---------
| Executives and senior business leaders|- What AI can do for your enterprise<br>- AI strategy<br>- Resource allocation
| Leaders of divisions working on AI projects|- Set project direction<br>- Resource allocation<br>- Monitor progress
| AI engineer trainees|- Build and ship AI software<br>- Gather data<br>- Execute on specific AI projects

- The smart CLO knows they should *curate* rather than *create* content

### 4. Develop an AI strategy
- Leverage AI to create an advantage specific to your industry sector
- Design strategy aligned with the "Virtuous Cycle of AI"
    - Better product -> More users -> More data -> Better product...
- If you enter an industry without a dominant AI presence, there's a chance
    - For an example, look at [Blue River Technology](https://bluerivertechnology.com/our-mission/), scrappy startup for agritech with John Deere
- Consider creating a data strategy
    - Strategic data acquisition (multi year chess games)
    - Unified data warehouse
- Create network effects and platform advantages
    - In industries with "winner take all" dynamics, AI can be an accelerator

### 5. Develop internal and external communications
- Investor relations
- Government relations
- Customer/user education
- Talent/recruitment
- Internal communications
