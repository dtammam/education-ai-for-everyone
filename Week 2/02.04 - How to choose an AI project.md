# 02.04 - How to choose an AI project

---

### AI knowledge and domain knowledge
- There's a certain set of things that AI can do
- There's also a certain set of things that are valuable for your business
- The idea is to select projects that are feasible with AI and valuable for your business
- AI experts have a sense of what is possible with AI, and domain experts have a sense of what is valuable for their business areas

### Brainstorming framework
- Think about automating *tasks* rather tan automating *jobs*.
    - Call center router
        - Pick up the phone
        - Respond to email
        - Provide a refund
            - Maybe email routing/refunds are amenable for automation
    - Radiologists
        - Read x-rays
        - Consult with other doctors
        - Mentor other doctors
        - Consult with patients
            - Maybe reading x-rays are amenable for automation

- What are the main drivers of business value?

- What are the main pain points in your business?

### You can make progress even without big data
- Having more data almost never hurts
- Data makes some businesses (like web search) defensible
    - There are a lot of rare web queries
    - Knowing these help provide a good search experience
- But with small datasets, you can still make progress

### For example
- If you make an automated visual inspection system, it would be great to have 1,000,000 pictures
- Sometimes, with as few as 100 pictures, or 1000, or maybe as few as 10, you may be able to get started on an ML project
- The amount of data you need is very project dependent
- There are some projects where small data will not be enough

### Due diligence on project
- Important to go through diligence to see if it is worth going through with the project

    - Technical diligence:
        - Can AI system meet desired performance
        - How much data is needed
        - Engineering timeline

    - Business diligence:
        - Lower costs (automate things or squeeze efficiency)
        - Increase revenue (drive checkouts)
        - Launch new product or business
            - Will this improve current business?
            - Will it improve new business?

    - Ethical diligence
        - Is what the system going to do make humanity better off
        - Is what the system going to do make society better off

### Build vs. buy
- Age old question in the IT world
- Equivalent challenge in the AI world
- Machine Learning projects can be in-house or outsourced
- Data science projects are more commonly done in-house
    - Usually they are often so closely tied to your business that it takes very deep, day-to-day knowledge of your business to do great data science projects
- Some things will be industry standard - avoid building those. "Don't sprint in front of a train" and embrace someone else's platform when possible
