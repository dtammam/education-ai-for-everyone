# 02.02 - Workflow of a data science project

---

### How a data science project workflow differs
- Unlike a machine learning project, the output of a data science project is often a set of actionable insights - insights that may cause you to do things differently. They have a different workflow

#### Optimizing a sales funnel
- Let's say you're selling coffee mugs, the flow is:
    1. User visits website
    2. User looks at multiple product pages
    3. User places items into shopping cart
    4. User checks out

1. Collect data

    | User ID | Country | Time | Webpage
    |:---------|:---------|:--------|:--------
    | 2009 | Spain | 08:34:30 Jan 5 | home.html
    | 2897 | USA | 13:20:22 May 18 | redmug.html
    | 4893 | Philippines | 22:45:16 Jun 11 | mug.html

2. Analyze data
    - Your data science team might have ideas about performance
        - They may think that overseas customers are afraid of shipping costs, so maybe put shipping into price
        - They may think there are blips in the data whenever there is a holiday. In some countries there are time of day blips

3. Suggest hypotheses/actions
    - Deploy changes
        - Incorporate shipping costs into product costs as an example
        - Change checkout policy
    - Re-analyze new data periodically
        - See if even better hypotheses/actions can be determined

#### Manufacturing line
- Let's say you're managing a manufacturing line for mugs
    1. Mix the clay
    2. Shape the mug
    3. Add glaze
    4. Fire kiln
    5. Final inspection

1. Collect data
    - We might gather information about the supplier of the clay we purchased
        | Clay batch # | Supplier | Mixing time minutes
        |:---------|:---------|:--------
        | 001 | ClayCo | 35
        | 034 | GooClay | 22
        | 109 | BrownStuff | 28
    - We might then get information about the batches for firing in the kiln
        | Mug batch # | Humidity | Temperature in kiln (f) | Duration in kiln (hours)
        |:---------|:---------|:--------|:--------
        |301|0.002%|1410|22
        |302|0.003%|1520|24
        |303|0.002%|1420|22

2. Analyze data
    - Iterate many times to get good insights
        - They might find out that whenever the humidity is too low or kiln temperature is too hot it leads to cracks
        - They might find out that it's warmer in the afternoon and we must adjust temperature/humidity depending on the time of day

3. Suggest hypotheses/actions
    - Deploy changes
    - Re-analyze new data periodically
