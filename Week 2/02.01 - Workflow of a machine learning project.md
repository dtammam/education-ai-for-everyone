# 02.01 - Workflow of a machine learning project

---

### Example: Speech recognizition
- Amazon Echo/Alexa
- Google Home
- Apple Siri
- Baidu DuerOS

### Key steps of a machine learning project
- Amazon Echo/Alexa
    1. Collect data
        - Get many examples of people saying either 'Alexa' or other things

    2. Train the model
        - Learn an a -> b mapping
        - (audio clip 1) "Alexa"
        - (audio clip 2) "Hello"
        - Iterate many times until its' good enough

    3. Deploy the model
        - Put it into a speaker
        - Start testing it
        - Get data back
        - Maintain and update the model

- Self-Driving Car
    1. Collect data
        - Get many examples of images of cars and positions of other cars that you want the AI system to output

    2. Train the model
        - "Label" the data and create a dataset by putting each car in a rectangle very precisely
        - Iterate many times until its' good enough

    3. Deploy the model
        - Put into cars on the road
        - Get data back
        - Maintain/update model
